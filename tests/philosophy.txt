bioassayR bulletproof testing and design philosophy

Answer these for each function before designing checks:
In each case it better for the user to get a warning, error, or just fix silently?
What if the input is length zero?
What if the input is length > 1 when length 1 was expected?
What if the input is of the wrong class?
What if the input contains (or is only) NA, blank, or null characters?
What if the input contains unexpected duplicates?
What if the input contains some invalid options or queries missing from the data?
What if the input contains only invalid options or queries missing from the data?

General function design questions:
Does the output order need to match the input order?
Has the user been informed if the output will match input order?
Is the functions name intuitive and unique?
Does the function deal properly with duplicates or missing entries in the data?

General class design criteria:
Every slot must have a bi-directional access function.
